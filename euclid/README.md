# Euclidean Tides
([Eucliean rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) on the EMFcamp 2022 Tidal Badge)

```
Here's looking at Euclid
Celebrate years
Here's looking at you kid
Wipe away tears
Long time since we're together
Now I hope it's forever

If you connect the GPIO pins of your badge to the supplied header, and thence
to TRS sockets, you get two pairs of Euclidean of Euclidean rhythms.

If you don't, you just get a blinkenlicht.

Three integers produce two rhythms for each TRS socket, select the parameter
with joystick left/right and alter them with joystick up/down.
